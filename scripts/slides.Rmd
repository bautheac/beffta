## Data-science finance: an emerging field

Bringing modern data collection and wrangling tools as well as statistical learning methods into finance: adapt & apply.


## Plan of action

Learning-by-doing approach to the data-science pipeline:

## Preprocessing: extract, load, transform (ELT)

* "Data-scientists spend most of their time massaging rather than mining data". Gil Press, *Forbes* columnist.  
* It is often reported that data preparation accounts for about 80% of the work of data-scientists.  
  
* Spend quality time constructing robust data extraction tools and building up your data wrangling skills; this project will help you on this.  


## Extract {.smaller}

* Pull financial data from Bloomberg for a market index as well as a cross-section of US stocks. 
  
* Organise the data in an excel workbook according to specific guidelines.  


## Load {.smaller}

* Using the R or Python programming languages, load the retrieved Bloomberg financial data in memory.  
  
* Organise the data in dataframes according to guidelines.  


## Transform {.smaller}

* Construct a returns dataframe.  
  
* For each stock construct an estimate of market risk and organise the results in a dataframe.  
  
* Construct a number of feature interactions: financial ratios.


## Explore, visualise

Explore and visualise the feature interactions dataset using appropriate visualisation tools.


## Model

* Unsupervised learning: clustering analysis.  
    + Using the k-means clustering algorithm, partition the feature interactions dataset into groups.  
    + Name the groups according to group-specific characteristics.  
  
* Supervised learning: classification analysis.
    + Merge the feature interactions dataset with the original datasets.
    + Try various classifiers on the resulting super-dataset where the target variable is the group label variable constructed above.  
    
## Communicate

You are free to present you work as you like.
